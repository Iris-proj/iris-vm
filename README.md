## About the Iris Project

The Iris project aims to create a comprehensive framework for building compilers and virtual machines. It provides a set of tools and libraries that make it easy to create new programming languages that can run on the Iris VM. The project's goal is to create an ecosystem similar to .NET, where multiple languages can interoperate and run on the same virtual machine.

## Features

* **Lightweight and Embeddable:** Iris VM is designed to be easily integrated into other applications.
* **Fast Execution:** The VM is optimized for speed and performance.
* **Object-Oriented:** Iris VM has built-in support for classes, instances, and methods.
* **Cross-Platform:** Iris VM can be compiled and run on various platforms.
